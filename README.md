Discord plugin for Jenkins
----------------------------------------------------------------

Provides Jenkins notification integration with Discord.

## Install Instructions

1. Get a Discord Webhook ID and Webhook Token(Integration Token): https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks
2. Install this plugin on your Jenkins server
3. Configure it in your Jenkins job (and optionally as global configuration) and **add it as a Post-build action**.

Webhook ID and Webhook Token(Integration Token): https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/(Webhook ID)/(Webhook Token)

#### Security

Use Jenkins Credentials and a credential ID to configure the Slack integration token. It is a security risk to expose your integration token using the previous *Integration Token* setting.

Create a new ***Secret text*** credential:

Select that credential as the value for the ***Integration Token Credential ID*** field:

#### Bot user option
This plugin supports sending notifications via bot users. You can enable bot user support from both 
global and project configurations. If the notification will be sent to a user via direct message, 
default integration sends it via @slackbot, you can use this option if you want to send messages via a bot user.
You need to provide credentials of the bot user for integration token credentials to use this feature. 

#### Jenkins Pipeline Support

Includes [Jenkins Pipeline](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin) support as of version 2.0:

```
slackSend color: 'good', message: 'Message from Jenkins Pipeline'
